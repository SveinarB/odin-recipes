        <h3>Minced meat on spaghetti sticks or whatever you wanna call 'em</h3>
        <p>Hi people and I'm back cooking..... Again. And today I'm going to be doin a different form of spaghetti bolognese</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>400gr minced meat</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Spaghetti sticks</li>
            <li>An onion</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Maybe we'll open a can of tomatoes</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First of all, we're gonna beat some eggs up</li>
            <li>And I got some spaghetti sticks here... Or whatever you wanna call em</li>
            <li>Right, I'm gonna put these egg in the.. Minced meat.. And I'm gonna mix the minced meat around</li>
            <li>And then what I'm going to do is.. Take me spaghetti sticks out. </li>
            <li>I don't even know how to do this.. I've seen it on video but I don't know how to do it..</li>
            <li>Grab the sticks.. Grab the soggy minced meat.. And put it around the sticks</li>
            <li>Then put it in the pan to go in the oven after putting soggy minced meat around 4 bundles of spaghetti sticks</li>
            <li>Pour some tomato sauce in there, as the guy in the video did it</li>
            <li>Remember to save some tomato sauce for after the first round of the oven</li>
            <li>Put them in the oven for about 20 minutes. Then we're gonna put the onion in</li>
            <li>Peel and cut an onion into pieces (this might make you cry)</li>
            <li>After the spaghetti sticks have been in the oven for 20 minutes, sprinkle the onion over</li>
            <li>Then top it with any spices of your choice</li>
            <li>Finish it off with the excess tomato sauce, and maybe open a tin of tomatoes</li>
            <li>I'm gonna open a tin of tomatoes as well, cuz it needs to be all covered</li>
            <li>Put it back in the oven for another half an hour or so, to cook the onions, then it should be OK.</li>
            <li>And that is a different Spag Bol!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Finished result should look something like this:</p>
