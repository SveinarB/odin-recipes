        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Making gingerbread men from scratch may seem intimidating, but it's actually quite easy. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below:</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons McCormick® Ginger, Ground</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon McCormick® Cinnamon, Ground</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon McCormick® Nutmeg, Ground</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>¾ cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup molasses</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon McCormick® Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt in large bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat butter and brown sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add molasses, egg, and vanilla; mix well. Gradually beat in flour mixture on low speed until well mixed.</li>
            <li>Press dough into a thick, flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut into gingerbread men shapes with a 5-inch cookie cutter. Place gingerbread men 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are set and just begin to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for 1 to 2 minutes, then remove to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Decorate cooled cookies as desired. Store cookies in airtight container up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
